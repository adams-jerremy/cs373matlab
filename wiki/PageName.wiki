In this project, we were to 'reverse engineer a tiny part of MATLAB.'

The methods we replicated are as follows:

    * add: add together two matrices of the same size, or a scalar to each element of a matrix
    * subtract: subtract from each other two matrices of the same size, or a scalar from each element of a matrix
    * multiply: multiply a scalar by each element of the matrix, or multiply two matrices of compatible sizes (the number of columns in the first matrix equal the number of rows in the second)
    * concat_cols: concatenate the columns of two matrices (comparable to MATLAB's horzcat)
    * concat_rows: concatenate the rows of two matrices (comparable to MATLAB's vertcat)
    * diag: returns the diagonal of a given matrix
    * eye: given a number of rows and columns, returns the identity matrix
    * ones: given a number of rows and colums, returns a matrix of ones
    * rand: given a number of rows and colums, returns a matrix of random values
    * slice_col: given a matrix and column number, returns that column
    * slice_row: given a matrix and column number, returns that row
    * sum_cols: returns the summed columns of a matrix
    * sum_rows: returns the summed rows of a matrix
    * transpose: swaps the rows and columns of a given matrix
    * tril: returns the lower triangular of a matrix, including the diagonal
    * triu: returns the upper triangular of a matrix, including the diagonal
    * zeros: given a number of rows and colums, returns a matrix of zeros 
    * sum_rows
