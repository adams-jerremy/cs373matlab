In this project, we were to 'reverse engineer a tiny part of MATLAB.'


= Details =

The methods we replicated are as follows:

    * add: add together two matrices of the same size, or a scalar to each element of a matrix
    * subtract: subtract from each other two matrices of the same size, or a scalar from each element of a matrix
    * multiply: multiply a scalar by each element of the matrix, or multiply two matrices of compatible sizes (the number of columns in the first matrix equal the number of rows in the second)
    * concat_cols: 
    * concat_rows
    * diag
    * eye
    * ones
    * rand
    * slice_col
    * slice_row
    * sum_cols
    * transpose
    * tril
    * triu
    * zeros
    * sum_rows
